abstract = {I simulate an ideal gas and observe how its macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic time evolution. First, I implement an event-based molecular dynamics engine of hard-sphere particles bouncing around inside a box. With this engine, I demonstrate that (1) particle speeds approach a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, (2) that the system agrees with the ideal gas law P V = N kBT , and (3) that fluctuations in local density decrease with N. These simulations verify that statistical mechanics is indeed a reliable framework for modeling large numbers of particles.},
